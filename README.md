# chatapp

A simple chatroom application.

Application will be separated into 2 parts, backend & frontend.
Will be divided into two primary folder, server and client.

Will be using NodeJS + MongoDB for backend, maybe I'll also try SQL based db and see how they perform relative to each other.
So, on the server, I will have a subfolder for certain server tech stack, such as NodeJS.

Will be using either VueJS / ReactJS for front-end, maybe I'll try both
Also, on the client, I will have a subfolder for certain client tech stack, such as React.
